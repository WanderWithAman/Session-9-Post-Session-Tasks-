Write an SQL query that:
1. Identify the staff member who processed the most orders.
2. Display the staff member's full name and the total number of orders they processed.

SELECT CONCAT(s.first_name,' ', s.last_name) AS staff_name, COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS total_orders FROM staffs s
JOIN orders o ON s.staff_id = o.staff_id
GROUP BY staff_name
ORDER BY total_orders DESC
LIMIT 1;
