Write an SQL query to:
1. Retrieve the store name, product name, and the total quantity sold for each product in that store.
2. Order the results by total quantity sold in descending order.
3. Ensure that aggregation is done correctly by joining relevant tables.

SELECT s.store_name, p.product_name, SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold
FROM stores s 
JOIN orders o ON s.store_id = o.store_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY s.store_name, p.product_name
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC;
