Write an SQL query that:
1. Joins the categories, products, order_items, and orders tables to gather necessary information.
2. Calculates the total revenue for each product category, taking into account the quantity sold, the list price, and any discounts applied.
3. Orders the results by total revenue in descending order to highlight the most profitable category.
4. Limits the result to only the top category with the highest revenue.

SELECT c.category_name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount/100)) AS total_revenue FROM categories c
JOIN products p ON c.category_id = p.category_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY c.category_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
