(Calculate the total number of products sold for each brand. By joining the brands, products, order_items, and orders tables, it computes the sum of quantities sold per brand, providing insight into which brands are performing the best in terms of sales.)
Write a query that retrieves the brand name and the total quantity of products sold for each brand. The results should be ordered by the total quantity sold in descending order.

SELECT b.brand_name, SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold FROM brands b
JOIN products p ON b.brand_id = p.brand_id
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY b.brand_name
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC;
