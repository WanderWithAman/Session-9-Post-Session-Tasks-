Write an SQL query that:
1. Calculate the total revenue generated by each staff member based on the orders they processed.
(The revenue generated from an order is calculated by multiplying the quantity of items sold, their list price, and the discount applied.)

SELECT CONCAT(s.first_name,' ', s.last_name) AS staff_name, 
SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * (1 - oi.discount/100)) AS total_revenue FROM staffs s
JOIN orders o ON s.staff_id = o.staff_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY staff_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
