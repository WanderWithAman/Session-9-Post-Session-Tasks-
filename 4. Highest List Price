Write an SQL query that:
1. Selects the product_name and list_price from the products table.
2. Filters the results to include only the product(s) whose list_price matches the maximum list price in the table.

SELECT product_name, list_price FROM products
WHERE list_price = (
  SELECT MAX(list_price) FROM order_items
);
