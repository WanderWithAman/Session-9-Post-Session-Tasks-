By joining the stores and orders tables, the query compares the shipped_date and required_date to count the number of late orders for each store. 
Task
Write a query to find stores where orders were shipped later than their required date, and return the store name along with the count of late orders. The results should be ordered by the number of late orders in descending order.

SELECT s.store_name, COUNT(o.order_status) AS late_orders_count
FROM stores s
JOIN orders o ON s.store_id = o.store_id
WHERE shipped_date > required_date
GROUP BY s.store_name
ORDER BY late_orders_count DESC;
