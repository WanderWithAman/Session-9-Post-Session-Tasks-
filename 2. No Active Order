Write an SQL query that:
1. Retrieve the names and email addresses of customers who have placed at least one order.
2. Ensure that all orders from these customers are either Rejected or Completed (status not in Pending (1) or Processing (2)).

SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email FROM customers c
JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
WHERE o.order_status > 1 AND 2
GROUP BY c.first_name, c.last_name, c.email;
