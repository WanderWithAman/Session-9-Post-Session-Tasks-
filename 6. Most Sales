For a given product category (e.g., Road Bikes)

SELECT s.store_name, SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_quantity_sold FROM stores s
JOIN orders o ON s.store_id = o.store_id
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
JOIN categories c ON p.category_id = c.category_id
WHERE category_name = 'Road Bikes'
GROUP BY s.store_name
ORDER BY total_quantity_sold DESC;
