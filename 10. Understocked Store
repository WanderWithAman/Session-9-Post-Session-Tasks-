Write an SQL query that:
1. Joins the stores, stocks, and products tables.
2. Filters products with quantities below the specified threshold i.e. 10 units.
3. Displays the store name, product name, and current stock quantity.
4. Sorts the results in ascending order of stock quantity for better readability.

SELECT  s.store_name, p.product_name, st.quantity FROM stores s
JOIN stocks st ON s.store_id = st.store_id
JOIN products p ON st.product_id = p.product_id
WHERE st.quantity < 10
ORDER BY st.quantity;
