Task
Write a query to find the store with the highest number of returns (orders with a status of 3, indicating rejection). The result should show the store name and the count of rejected orders, ordered by the number of returns in descending order.
(Identify the store with the highest number of product returns, which is determined by the number of orders with an order status of "Rejected" (status code 3). By joining the stores and orders tables, the query counts the rejected orders for each store, helping to analyze returns and potentially flag issues with product quality or customer satisfaction.)

SELECT s.store_name, COUNT(o.order_status) AS returns_count FROM stores s
JOIN orders o ON s.store_id = o.store_id
WHERE o.order_status = 3
GROUP BY s.store_name
ORDER BY returns_count DESC;
