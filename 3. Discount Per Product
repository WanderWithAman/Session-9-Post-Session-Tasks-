Write an SQL query to:
1. Calculate the total discount amount for each product by using the formula: total_discount = quantity * list_price * discount / 100
2. Retrieve the product names and their corresponding total discount amounts.
3. Sort the results by the total discount amount in descending order to show the most discounted products first.

SELECT p.product_name, SUM(oi.quantity * oi.list_price * oi.discount / 100) AS total_discount
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
GROUP BY p.product_name
ORDER BY total_discount DESC;
